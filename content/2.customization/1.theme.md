# Themes
Themes allow you to customize the appearance of your site. You can either use the pre-built themes provided or create your own custom theme.

By default, **Lum[eex]{style="color: #1ad6ff"}** includes two ready-to-use themes:


::card{icon=fluent-color:design-ideas-48}
#title

## Theme configuration file

```sh hl_lines="5"
lumeex/
└── config/
    └── themes/
        └── your_theme/

Each theme must include a `theme.yaml` file. This file defines the customizable variables that control your site’s look and feel. Refer to other sections for detailed setup instructions.
