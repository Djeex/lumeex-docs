# Build the site

Once your `site.yaml` and `gallery.yaml` files are properly configured, you can build your site to generate the necessary static files.


## Building
---
Ensure you are in the `lumeex/` directory, then run:

```sh
python3 build.py
```

And you're done.

## Testing
---
You can preview your site locally using Python’s built-in web server:
```sh
python3 -m http.server 3000 --directory output
```
This will serve your static files at http://localhost:3000. Use `Ctrl` + `C` to stop the server.

  - If you are developing on a remote machine, replace `localhost` with your remote machine’s IP address to access the site externally.

## Deploying your site
---

The generated files are located in the `lumeex/output/`directory. Simply upload or copy these files to your preferred web server to publish your site.
