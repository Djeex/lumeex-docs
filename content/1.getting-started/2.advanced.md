# Getting started

**Lum[eex]{style="color: #1ad6ff"}** is a Python project that can be installed on any operating system with Docker or Python support.

## 🐳 Docker Installation from Git repository
---
For conveniency, you can use Docker to run the project. **Lum[eex]{style="color: #1ad6ff"}** provides a pre-built image or let you build it from the [Git](https://git.djeex.fr/Djeex/lumeex.git) project.

Before installing, ensure the following is available on your system

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)


1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://git.djeex.fr/Djeex/lumeex.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory
```sh
cd lumeex/
```

3. Run the container

::code-group
```sh [Docker run]
sudo docker build .. -t lumeex \
&& sudo docker run -d \
  --name lmx \
  -v ./config:/app/config \
  -v ./output:/app/output \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -e PREVIEW_PORT=3000 \
  -e WEBUI_PORT=5000 \
  lumeex
```
```sh [Docker compose]
sudo docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```
::

__You’re ready to go!__ The container is now running and ready for use. You can reach the WebUI on http://localhost:5000, and, after a first build, the preview of your gallery on http://localhost:3000.

::alert{type="success"}
✨ __Tip:__ The container exposes two services: the **WebUI** and the **preview server**. Both require a host port to be mapped. If a port is already in use on your system, you can remap it by updating both the `-p` (port mapping) and the corresponding `-e` (environment variable). For example, to run the preview server on port `4000` instead of the default `3000`, use:`-p 4000:3000` and `-e PREVIEW_PORT=4000`. For docker compose, open the existing `.env` file, then fill it with your custom port. For example, to run the preview server on port `4000` instead of the default `3000`:
  ```properties
  PREVIEW_PORT=4000
  WEBUI_PORT=5000
  ```
::

4. (Optional) stopping the container _(the files will persist in your config and output directory)_

::code-group
```sh [Docker run]
sudo docker stop lmx
```
```sh [Docker compose]
sudo docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yaml stop
```
::


## 🐍 Python Installation
---

You can also choose to install the project directly on your device with Python. Before installing, ensure the following are available on your system

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/) or higher  

### Installation
Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://git.djeex.fr/Djeex/lumeex.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory
```sh
cd lumeex
```

3. Create a virtual environment
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment
```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

5. Install project dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Launch the WebUI
```sh
Python3 -m src.py.webui.webui
```

__You’re ready to go!__ The project is now installed and ready for use. You can reach the WebUI on http://localhost:5000. See [CLI users section](../cli-users/site) for further commands.
