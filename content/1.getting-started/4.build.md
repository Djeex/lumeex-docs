# Build the site

Once your `site.yaml` and `gallery.yaml` files are properly configured, you can build your site to generate the necessary static files.


## Building
---

Run the following command to build your site:

::code-group
```sh [Docker]
sudo docker exec -it lmx build
```
```sh [Python]
python3 gallery.py
```
::

::alert{type="warning"}
:::list{type="warning"}
  - __Python:__ Make sure to run the script from the `lumeex/` directory; otherwise, it will not be found.
:::
::

And you're done.

## Testing
---
You can preview your site locally using the built-in web server.

- **If you use Docker** you can immediately check it at http://localhost:3000.

- **If you use Python**, run:
  ```sh
  python3 -m http.server 3000 --directory output
  ```
  This will serve your static files at http://localhost:3000. Use `Ctrl` + `C` to stop the server.


::alert{type="info"}
:::list{type="info"}
  - If you are developing on a remote machine, replace `localhost` with your remote machine’s IP address to access the site externally.
::


## Deploying your site
---

The generated files are located in the `lumeex/output/`directory. Simply upload or copy these files to your preferred web server to publish your site.

::alert{type="warning"}
:::list{type="warning"}
  - Important: Do not use Docker or Python’s built-in web server for production deployments.
