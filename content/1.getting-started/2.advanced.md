# Getting started

**Lum[eex]{style="color: #1ad6ff"}** is a Python project that can be installed on any operating system with Docker or Python support.

## 🐳 Docker Installation from Git repository
---
For conveniency, you can use Docker to run the project. **Lum[eex]{style="color: #1ad6ff"}** provides a pre-built image or let you build it from the [Git](https://git.djeex.fr/Djeex/lumeex.git) project.

Before installing, ensure the following is available on your system

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)


1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://git.djeex.fr/Djeex/lumeex.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory
```sh
cd lumeex/
```

3. Run the container

::code-group
```sh [Docker run]
sudo docker build .. -t lumeex \
&& sudo docker run -d \
  --name lmx \
  -v ./config:/app/config \
  -v ./output:/app/output \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  lumeex
```
```sh [Docker compose]
sudo docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```
::

__You’re ready to go!__ The container is now running and ready for use. You can reach the WebUI on http://localhost:5000, and, after a first build, the preview of your gallery on http://localhost:3000.

::alert{type="info"}
:::list{type="info"}
- __Ports :__ Ports are used for webui and preview server. If port `3000` is already used, juste change `3000:3000` in your docker run command or `docker-compose.yaml` file by `your-custom-port:3000`. The same goes for the `5000` port.
:::
::

4. (Optional) stopping the container _(the files will persist in your config and output directory)_

::code-group
```sh [Docker run]
sudo docker stop lmx
```
```sh [Docker compose]
sudo docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yaml stop
```
::


## 🐍 Python Installation
---

You can also choose to install the project directly on your device with Python. Before installing, ensure the following are available on your system

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/) or higher  

### Installation
Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://git.djeex.fr/Djeex/lumeex.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory
```sh
cd lumeex
```

3. Create a virtual environment
```sh
