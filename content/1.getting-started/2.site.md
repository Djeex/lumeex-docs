# Setting up your site

After completing the installation, you’re ready to configure your site.

## Minimal Configuration
---


All user configuration files are located in the `config/` directory:

```sh hl_lines="3"
lumeex/
└── config/
    ├── site.yaml
    ├── gallery.yaml
    ├── photos/
    │   ├── gallery
    │   └── hero
    └── themes/
        ├── modern
        └── typewriter 
```


The main configuration file is `site.yaml`. This file contains all your site’s metadata and settings.

### Info

The `info` section contains informations about your header. 

```yaml
info:
  title: Your Site Title
  subtitle: Your Site Subtitle
  description: A brief description of your site
  keywords: keyword1, keyword2, keyword3
  canonical: https://yoursite.com
  author: Your Name
```

### Social Links

While there is no dedicated author field, you can add an Instagram URL. This will display an Instagram icon linked to your profile in both the menu and footer. You can also specify a thumbnail image for social sharing; it will be automatically cropped and resized.

```yaml
social:
  instagram_url: https://www.instagram.com/yourprofile
  thumbnail: gallery/anyphoto.png  # Relative path from photos/gallery or photos/hero directories
```

### Navigation Menu

Customize your navigation menu by specifying items. It’s common to use photo tags to filter content dynamically. For example:
```yaml
menu:
  items:
    - label: Home
      href: /
    - label: Gallery1
      href: /?tag=tag1,tag3
    - label: Gallery2
      href: /?tag=tag2

```
### Footer

The `footer` appears at the bottom of every page. Use it to provide copyright and legal information:
```yaml
footer:
  copyright: Copyright © 2025 Your Name
  legal_link: '/legals.html'
  legal_label: Legal notice
```

### Legals section

Configure your legal page content to comply with local regulations:

```yaml
legals:
  hoster_name: Your Hosting Provider
  hoster_address: Hosting Provider Address
  hoster_contact: Hosting Provider Contact Information
  intellectual_property:
    - paragraph: "Insert your legal text here."
    - paragraph: "Additional legal information."
    - paragraph: "Further details as needed."
```

### Build

The build section contains settings for the build process. At minimum, specify a theme. **Lum[eex]{style="color: #1ad6ff"}** includes two themes by default:  [modern](modern.djeex.fr) and [typewriter](https://typewriter.djeex.fr).

```yaml
build:
  theme: modern
```

To optimize loading times, the build process automatically converts images to `.webp` format—a modern, lightweight image format—and resizes photos to a maximum width of 1140 pixels, matching the gallery’s display width.

If you prefer to disable image conversion and resizing, set the following options to `false`:

```yaml hl_lines="3 4"
build:
  theme: modern
  convert_images: false
  resize_images: false
```

**You’re all set!** For any questions or advanced configurations, please refer to the additional documentation or open an issue on the repository.
