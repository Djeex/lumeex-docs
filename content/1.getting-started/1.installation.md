# Getting started

**Lum[eex]{style="color: #1ad6ff"}** is a Python project that can be installed on any operating system with Docker or Python support.

## üê≥ Docker
---
For conveniency, you can use Docker to run the project. **Lum[eex]{style="color: #1ad6ff"}** provide a pre-compiled [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) image or let you build it from the [Git](https://git.djeex.fr/Djeex/lumeex.git) project.

Before installing, ensure the following is available on your system

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

### From **Lum[eex]{style="color: #1ad6ff"}** official image

From your terminal, create a `lumeex/` directory, then navigate to it:
```sh
mkdir lumeex
cd lumeex
```

Now you have two way to run the **Lum[eex]{style="color: #1ad6ff"}** container.

#### Use docker run

```sh [Docker run]
sudo docker build . -t lumeex \
&& sudo docker run -d \
  --name lmx \
  -v ./config:/app/config \
  -v ./output:/app/output \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  git.djeex.fr/djeex/lumeex:latest
```

__You‚Äôre ready to go!__ The container is now running and ready for use.

#### Or use docker compose

1. First, create a file named `docker-compose.yaml` in a directory of your choice:
```yaml
services:
  lumeex:
    container_name: lmx
    image: git.djeex.fr/djeex/lumeex:latest
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config  # mount config directory
      - ./output:/app/output  # mount output directory
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```
2. Start the container from the same directory:
```sh
sudo docker compose up -d
```

__You‚Äôre ready to go!__ The container is now running and ready for use.

#### Stopping the container

To stop the container, you can use:
::code-group
```sh [Docker run]
sudo docker stop lmx
```
```sh [Docker compose]
sudo docker compose stop
```
::

### From Git repository
First, ensure [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://git.djeex.fr/Djeex/lumeex.git
```

2. Navigate to the project `docker/` directory
```sh
cd lumeex
```

3. Run the container

::code-group
```sh [Docker run]
sudo docker build . -t lumeex \
&& sudo docker run -d \
  --name lmx \
  -v ./config:/app/config \
  -v ./output:/app/output \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  lumeex
```
```sh [Docker compose]
sudo docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```
::

- __Ports :__ Ports are used for preview your static site at https://localhost:3000 or https://yourserverip:3000. If port `3000` is already used, juste change `3000:3000` in your docker run command or `docker/docker-compose.yaml` file by `your-custom-port:3000`.
:::
::

__You‚Äôre ready to go!__ The container is now running and ready for use.

4. (Optional) stopping the container _(the files will persist in your config and output directory)_

::code-group
```sh [Docker run]
sudo docker stop lmx
```
```sh [Docker compose]
sudo docker compose -f .docker/docker-compose.yaml stop
```
::


## üêç Python
---

You can also choose to install the project directly on your device with Python. Before installing, ensure the following are available on your system

### Installation
Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://git.djeex.fr/Djeex/lumeex.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory
```sh
cd lumeex
```

3. Create a virtual environment
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment
```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

5. Install project dependencies
