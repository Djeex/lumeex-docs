# ðŸ”§ Docs, More Docs

**DocuÂ·djeex** is first and foremost a personal project aimed at self-hosting as many everyday services as possible â€” without relying on proprietary platforms (Google, Apple, Netflix, etc.).  
This documentation site is built using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/).

This repository contains everything you need to edit pages, apply your changes, and redeploy the site.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development Environment (port 3000)

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Generate Static Pages

```bash
npm run generate
```

The HTML files will be generated in the `.output/public` folder and are ready to be deployed on any static-compatible hosting.

## Preview Build

If you'd like to immediately see the result of your static site build, you can launch a preview server:

```bash
npm run preview
```
